-- Control signals via Control Unit --

The counter lines

LD = FETCH3
INC = FETCH1; FETCH2; ADD1; AND1
CLR = ADD2; AND2; JMP1; INC1

The 5 load lines

AR is loaded during FETCH1; FETCH3
PC is loaded during JMP1
DR is loaded during FETCH2; ADD1; AND1
AC is loaded during ADD2; AND2
IR is loaded during FETCH3


The 2 increment lines

PC is incremented during FETCH2
AC is incremented during INC1


The 3 tri-state buffers

PC placed on system bus during FETCH1 (SYSTEMBUSSEL 0)
DR placed on system bus during FETCH3; ADD2; AND2; JMP1 (SYSTEMBUSSEL 1)
Memory contents placed on system bus during FETCH2; ADD1; AND1 (SYSTEMBUSSEL 2)


ALUSEL is HIGH during AND2 (0 for ADD, 1 for AND)


The READ signal (unneeded; equivalent to MEMBUS above)
